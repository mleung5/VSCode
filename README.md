# VSCode: a how-to guide for "edit local; remote update"
- This is simply a personal journal log, created originally to serve my aging memory only.
- I elobrated it with a little more description and added a few more pictures.
- This guide assumes Windows. But the underlying concept is essentially the same for Mac.
- It's just how I did it. I am sure there are other better / easier ways for that.
- Please feel free to share. We all learn and grow together.
